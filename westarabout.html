            Founded in May 2022 by Bhavya Gandhi, WeStarPrints began as a passion project and quickly grew into a thriving business, turning the art of 3D printing into a 
            tailored service that meets the unique needs of each customer. What started as a hobby has evolved into a company that specializes in designing and printing
            custom 3D items, ensuring that every creation is personalized to the customer's exact specifications.<br><br>
            Bhavya is currently pursuing a medical degree at the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine.
            At WeStarPrints, Bhavya oversees all aspects of the businessâ€”from managing finances, supplies and advertising. <br><br>
            As WeStarPrints continues to grow, our mission remains clear: to combine creativity, precision, and customer care in every project we undertake. We look
            forward to bringing your ideas to life, one print at a time.
